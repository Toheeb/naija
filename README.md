# naija
An utility library about Nigeria; her states, local government areas, and towns. More data will be added with time

# NB
This is currently experimental. 
- You will need Node version that can run es6 modules directly. The latest version as of writing (13.9.0) does
- The towns may be wrong. The data was what I used in a previous project however I noticed they needed improvements. I needed to use this as a package, hence the reason creating this. Afterwards, I will be updating to keep the data accurate. Once the data is accurate, the version no of this package will be 1.0.0. 
- Contributions are welcome! And it could be either of the following...
  - Fix town names
  - Provide helper functions to query the data 
  - Add more static information pertaining to Nigeria 
  - And your suggestions



# Test
```npm test``` runs ```test.js``` to list out all Nigerian States.
